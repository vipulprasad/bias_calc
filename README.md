Calculating bias from N-body simulation data

This repository contains Python codes to read the Abacus Summit N-body simulation data and calculate dark matter halo bias.
The code can calculate cross-correlation bias $b(m1, m2)$ of halos in different mass bins centered at $m1$ and $m2$ and can compare whether $b(m1, m2) == \sqrt{b(m1)b(m2)}$.
